Rhythm Rush is a browser-based rhythm game inspired by *Piano Tiles*. Tap the falling tiles as they reach the bottom line to score points. 
Built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, it works smoothly on both desktop and mobile.

## 🤔💡 How to Play 

- **Start the game:** Click the “Play” button on the screen (or press the **Space** key) to begin a round.  

- **Tap the tiles:** Black tiles will start falling down through four columns. Tap each tile as it reaches the horizontal *hit line* at the bottom of the screen.  

- **Score points:** Each successful tile tap earns you 1 point. The tile will light up or flash to indicate a correct hit.  

- **Avoid misses:** If a tile passes the hit line without being tapped, or if you tap when no tile is there, the game ends immediately (**Game Over**).  

- **Pause/Resume:** You can pause the game by clicking **Pause** (or pressing **Space**). To continue, press **Space** again or click the **Resume** button.  

- **High score:** After the game is over, your final score is shown and compared to your best score. Try again to beat it!

## 📝ℹ️ How it Works (Game Logic) 

- The game runs completely in your browser using **HTML5 canvas** for graphics.  
- A continuous game loop makes the tiles fall smoothly down the screen.  
- New tiles appear randomly in one of four columns. As time passes, they drop faster and more often to make the game harder.  
- When you tap a tile right as it crosses the hit line:
  - The game counts it as a **hit**.  
  - A short tone plays for feedback.  
  - Your score goes up by 1.  
- If your score beats your previous best, the new **high score** is saved in your browser so it’s there next time.  
- If you miss a tile or tap the wrong spot:
  - The game ends immediately (**Game Over**).  
  - A different sound plays.  
  - An overlay shows your final score and your best score.
